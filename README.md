# HackThis2020

# Description
Apingo is a tool to be used alongside online lectures with a smaller class size of 20-30. With online lectures, student engagement with the teacher is limited to either the chat box linked to the lecture software or actual talking via the voice/video channel. However, many students are reluctant to turn on cameras or speak up in front of the entire class especially in an online setting. This leaves the chat software to be a messy primary way to engage with the students. Apingo helps to solve this problem by using a free response answer to help the teacher engage with the students as well as a ping function to let the teacher know if the student is unclear about their answer or a topic in general.

# Use
All functionality is hosted by Google Firebase Hosting, and the app can be accessed at https://apingo.web.app/
The teacher is able to host a room that the students can join, and the teacher asks students questions while the students can answer.
